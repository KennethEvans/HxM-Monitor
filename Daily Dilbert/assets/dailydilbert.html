<h3 align="center">Daily Dilbert </h3>
<p align="left">This application displays Dilbert comic strips from <a href="http://dilbert.com">dilbert.com</a>. It is a specialized browser in that respect.  It is for your personal use only. It may stop working if the way the strips are stored at dilbert.com changes. The images are subject to the rights and restrictions that may be found at that site. </p>
<p align="left">The application caches the last 5 strips on the SD card if there is one. Otherwise no strips are saved, and each new one must loaded from the web. If a strip has come from the cache, then its title is white. If it came from the web, then its title is blue. There is  a progress bar when getting strips from the web. It can be cancelled with the back button, but you will probably have to be fast to do so.</p>
<p align="left"> You can view different strips via the Next, Prev, First, and Today menu items. In addition, there are arrow buttons to go to the next and previous ones. Swiping to the left or right will also go to the next or previous strip, respectively. The first strip corresponds to May 16, 1989. </p>
<h3 align="left">Menu Items </h3>
<h4>Next, Prev, First, Today </h4>
<p>Get the next, previous, first, or today's strip. </p>
<h4>Date</h4>
<p>Get the strip for a date you select. </p>
<h4>Save</h4>
<p>Save a PNG image of the current strip on the SD card. The images will be found in the Dilbert directory on the SD card. Does nothing if there is no SD card. </p>
<h4>Share</h4>
<p>Share this image via one of the applications on the device that is capable of sharing, such as email. You can choose the application from a list if there is more than one. The file to be used is saved internally and deleted when Daily Dilbert finishes to help keep storage low. It may thus not be available if the other application does not use it before Daily Dilbert finishes. </p>
